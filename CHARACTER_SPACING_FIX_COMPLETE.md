# Character Spacing Issues - FIXED! ✅

## Problem Identified
Your PDFs had severe character spacing issues caused by:
1. **Embedded File References**: `0 4:0†Dac Investor Deck.pdf0` strings treated as single "words"
2. **Poor Font Kerning**: Default Helvetica font with limited character spacing control
3. **Text Justification Issues**: Long unbreakable strings causing extreme word stretching
4. **Unicode Characters**: Polish characters like `ę` causing spacing problems

## Solution Applied

### 1. **Enhanced Text Sanitization** ✅
```typescript
// Removes embedded file references that cause spacing issues
.replace(/\d+\s*\d+:\d+†[^0]*\.pdf\d*/g, '')
.replace(/\d+\s*\d+:\d+[^0]*\.pdf\d*/g, '')
```
**Result**: Eliminates those problematic `0 4:0†Dac Investor Deck.pdf0` strings

### 2. **Better Font Selection** ✅
```typescript
// Use Times font for better character spacing
pdf.setFont('times', 'normal');
```
**Result**: Times font provides superior character spacing and kerning control

### 3. **Enhanced Text Processing** ✅
```typescript
function processTextForPDF(text: string): string {
  // Break up long words that might cause spacing issues
  .replace(/(\w{20,})/g, (match) => {
    if (match.includes('.')) return match; // Keep URLs intact
    return match.replace(/(.{15})/g, '$1 ').trim(); // Break long words
  })
  // Ensure proper spacing around punctuation
  .replace(/([.!?])([A-Z])/g, '$1 $2')
  .replace(/([a-z])([A-Z])/g, '$1 $2')
}
```
**Result**: Intelligent word breaking and punctuation spacing

### 4. **Improved Typography** ✅
- **Font Size**: Increased from 11pt to 12pt for better readability
- **Line Height**: Increased from 5.5pt to 6pt for better spacing
- **Paragraph Spacing**: Increased from 3pt to 4pt
- **Heading Size**: 13pt for better hierarchy

### 5. **Enhanced Heading Detection** ✅
```typescript
const isHeading = paragraph.length < 80 && (
  paragraph === paragraph.toUpperCase() || 
  /^\d+\./.test(paragraph) ||
  paragraph.startsWith('•') ||
  paragraph.includes('—') || // Em dash often used in headings
  paragraph.includes(':') && paragraph.length < 50
);
```
**Result**: Better detection of headings with em dashes and colons

### 6. **Unicode Character Handling** ✅
```typescript
'\u0105': 'a', // Polish ę -> a
'\u0119': 'e', // Polish ę -> e
'\u0107': 'c', // Polish ć -> c
// ... and more Polish characters
```
**Result**: Clean ASCII text without spacing issues
