# Implementation Summary - Team Analysis with PDF Generation

## 🎉 What Was Built

A complete, production-ready system for AI-powered team analysis with professional PDF report generation. When an investor clicks "Analyze Team" on a company's pitch deck, the system:

1. ✅ Sends the PDF to OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo
2. ✅ Uses a custom prompt from the database
3. ✅ Generates comprehensive team analysis
4. ✅ Creates a professionally formatted PDF report
5. ✅ Saves the PDF to Supabase Storage
6. ✅ Links everything in the database (investor → company → analysis → report)
7. ✅ Provides a download link in the UI

## 📊 Database Schema
