# Create Buttons Prerequisites Implementation

## Summary
Implemented a feature to enforce that all 4 foundational "Analyze" reports must be generated before allowing users to create derivative reports on the Venture Detail screen.

## Changes Made

### File Modified: `src/components/VentureDetail.tsx`

#### 1. Added Helper Function (Lines 1183-1188)
```typescript
// Helper function to check if all 4 required analyze reports exist
const hasAllRequiredAnalysisReports = (): boolean => {
  const requiredReports = ['product-analysis', 'team-analysis', 'market-analysis', 'financial-analysis'];
  const existingReportTypes = analysisReports.map(report => report.report_type.toLowerCase());
  return requiredReports.every(reportType => existingReportTypes.includes(reportType));
};
```

This function checks if all 4 required analysis reports exist:
- Product-Analysis
- Team-Analysis
- Market-Analysis
- Financial-Analysis

#### 2. Updated Button Disable Logic (Lines 1385-1396)
Modified the `renderButton` function to:
- Check if all required analysis reports exist
- Disable Create buttons when prerequisites are not met
- Apply the check to all 4 Create buttons:
  - Create-ScoreCard
  - Create-DetailReport
  - Create-DiligenceQuestions
  - Create-FounderReport

#### 3. Added Tooltip Help Text (Lines 1398-1401)
```typescript
const tooltipText = isCreateButton && !allAnalysisReportsExist
  ? 'All 4 Analyze reports (Product, Team, Market, Financials) must be generated first'
  : undefined;
```

Users can hover over disabled Create buttons to see why they're disabled.

#### 4. Added Visual Info Banner (Lines 1461-1466)
When Create buttons are disabled, a prominent amber-colored information banner appears:
```
ℹ️ Note: All 4 Analyze reports (Product, Team, Market, Financials) must be generated 
before you can create ScoreCard, DetailReport, DiligenceQuestions, or FounderReport.
```

## User Experience

### Before All Analysis Reports Are Generated:
1. **Create buttons are disabled** - visually dimmed with 50% opacity
2. **Tooltip appears on hover** - explains the prerequisite requirement
3. **Info banner displays** - prominent visual reminder under the Create button row
4. **Buttons show "Creating..."** if clicked (though disabled)

### After All Analysis Reports Are Generated:
1. **Create buttons become enabled** - full color and clickable
2. **Tooltip removed** - no longer needed
3. **Info banner hidden** - visual clutter reduced
4. **Normal functionality restored** - users can create derivative reports

## Benefits

1. **Enforces Logical Workflow**: Ensures comprehensive analysis is completed before summary reports are generated
2. **Data Quality**: Prevents incomplete or low-quality summary reports
3. **Clear User Guidance**: Multiple visual cues explain what's needed
4. **Non-Breaking**: Doesn't affect existing functionality, only adds a prerequisite check
5. **Responsive Design**: Works in both light and dark modes

## Technical Notes

- The check is case-insensitive (uses `.toLowerCase()`)
- Report type matching handles variations in naming conventions
- The feature updates dynamically as reports are generated
- No database changes required - purely frontend logic

## Testing Recommendations

1. Verify Create buttons are disabled when fewer than 4 analysis reports exist
2. Verify Create buttons become enabled once all 4 reports are generated
3. Hover over disabled Create buttons to see tooltip
4. Check info banner appears/disappears correctly
5. Test in both light and dark modes
6. Verify existing analysis generation functionality still works

## Deployment

No backend or database changes required. Simply deploy the updated `VentureDetail.tsx` component.
