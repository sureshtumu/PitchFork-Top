# Registration Data Pre-fill & Documents Display - Complete

## 🎉 What Was Fixed

Successfully implemented two important improvements:
1. Pre-fill company name and phone from registration when founders use manual entry
2. Always display documents section in VentureDetail (not hidden behind analysis status)

---

## ✅ Changes Made

### **Fix 1: FounderSubmission - Pre-fill Registration Data**

**File:** `src/components/FounderSubmission.tsx`

#### Updated `useEffect` to Load Company Data

**Before:** Only pre-filled contact_name and email from user metadata

**After:** Fetches company record from database and pre-fills:
- ✅ **Company Name** (from registration)
- ✅ **Phone Number** (from registration)
- ✅ Contact Name (from company record or user metadata)
- ✅ Email (from company record or user metadata)

**Implementation:**
```typescript
React.useEffect(() => {
  const loadUserData = async () => {
    const currentUser = await getCurrentUser();
    const companyId = sessionStorage.getItem('companyId');

    if (companyId) {
      // Fetch company record created during registration
      const { data: companyRecord } = await supabase
        .from('companies')
        .select('name, phone, email, contact_name')
        .eq('id', companyId)
        .maybeSingle();
      
      if (companyRecord) {
        // Pre-fill with registration data
        setCompanyData(prev => ({
          ...prev,
          name: companyRecord.name || '',              // ← NEW!
          phone: companyRecord.phone || '',            // ← NEW!
          contact_name: companyRecord.contact_name || ...,
          email: companyRecord.email || ...
        }));
      }
    }
  };
}, [navigate]);
```

**What Gets Pre-filled from Registration:**
1. Company Name (from signup form's "companyName" field)
2. Phone Number (from signup form's "phoneNumber" field)
3. Contact Name (from first + last name)
4. Email (from user account email)

---

### **Fix 2: VentureDetail - Always Show Documents**

**File:** `src/components/VentureDetail.tsx`

#### Moved Documents & Reports Outside Conditional Section

**Before:** Documents and reports were INSIDE "Analysis Results Section"
- Only showed when `company.status === 'Analyzed'`
- Hidden for Submitted, In-Diligence, Rejected companies

**After:** Documents and reports are SEPARATE sections
- Always visible (if files exist)
- Show regardless of analysis status
- Each in their own card

**Changes:**
1. ✅ Extracted "Uploaded Documents" into separate card
2. ✅ Extracted "Analysis Reports" into separate card
3. ✅ Both sections always visible (not conditional on status)
4. ✅ Better visual hierarchy with section headers
5. ✅ Improved text contrast for dark mode

Email

```

**After (Manual Entry):**

SELECT id FROM analysis
WHERE company_id = {company-id}
AND investor_user_id = {current-investor-id};
