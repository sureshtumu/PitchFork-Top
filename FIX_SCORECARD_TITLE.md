# Score-Card Title Fix - COMPLETE âœ…

## Issue
The Create Score Card button was generating reports with the title "Investment Score Card" but the user wanted it simply called "Score-Card".

## What Was Fixed

### 1. âœ… **Edge Function Configuration**
**File**: `supabase/functions/analyze-company/index.ts`

**Changed**:
```typescript
scorecard: {
  promptName: 'Create-ScoreCard',
  reportTitle: 'Investment Score Card',  // OLD
  // ... rest of config
}
```

**To**:
```typescript
scorecard: {
  promptName: 'Create-ScoreCard',
  reportTitle: 'Score-Card',  // NEW - Simple and clean!
  // ... rest of config
}
```

### 2. âœ… **Edge Function Deployed**
The updated function has been deployed to Supabase. All new score cards generated will use "Score-Card" as the title.

### 3. âœ… **Documentation Updated**
Updated the following documentation files to reflect the correct title:
- `CREATE_SCORECARD_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
- `ALL_CREATE_FEATURES_COMPLETE.md`

## Database Impact

**Good News**: No database updates needed! âœ…

The `analysis_reports` table stores:
- `report_type`: `'scorecard-analysis'` (unchanged)
- `file_name`: Generated dynamically (unchanged)
- `file_path`: Storage path (unchanged)

The **report title** only appears in:
- The PDF header (generated dynamically from edge function)
- The UI display (comes from the PDF or report type)

Since the title is generated on-the-fly when creating PDFs, all future score cards will automatically use "Score-Card" as the title.

## Existing Reports

**Existing score card reports** (if any) will still have the old title "Investment Score Card" in their PDFs since the title was baked into the PDF when it was generated.

**New reports** generated after this fix will show "Score-Card".

If you want to regenerate existing score cards with the new title:
1. Delete the old score card report
2. Click "Create Score Card" again
3. New PDF will have "Score-Card" as the title

## Testing

To verify the fix:
1. Navigate to any company
2. Click "Create Score Card"
3. Wait for generation
4. Download the PDF
5. **Verify**: PDF header shows "Score-Card" (not "Investment Score Card")

## Summary

âœ… Report title changed from "Investment Score Card" to "Score-Card"
âœ… Edge function configuration updated
âœ… Edge function deployed
âœ… Documentation updated
âœ… No database changes needed
âœ… All future score cards will use "Score-Card"

**The fix is live and ready to use!** ðŸŽ‰
