# Manual vs AI Update Choice - Implementation Complete

## 🎉 What Was Implemented

Successfully added founder choice between AI-powered extraction and manual data entry when submitting pitch decks.

---

## ✅ Changes Made

### File: `src/components/FounderSubmission.tsx`

#### 1. Added New Function: `skipToManualEntry()`

Allows founders to skip AI analysis and go directly to manual form entry.

```typescript
const skipToManualEntry = async () => {
  if (!pitchDeckFile) {
    setMessage({ type: 'error', text: 'Please select a pitch deck file first' });
    return;
  }

  try {
    setIsLoading(true);
    
    const companyId = sessionStorage.getItem('companyId');
    
    // Upload pitch deck to storage
    const filePath = `${companyId}/${pitchDeckFile.name}`;
    await supabase.storage
      .from('company-documents')
      .upload(filePath, pitchDeckFile);
    
    // Save document record
    await supabase.from('documents').insert([{
      company_id: companyId,
      filename: pitchDeckFile.name,
      document_name: 'Pitch Deck',
      description: 'Main pitch deck presentation',
      path: filePath
    }]);
    
    // Skip AI - go directly to company form
    setMessage({ type: 'success', text: 'Pitch deck uploaded! Please fill in your company information below.' });
    setCurrentStep('company');
    
  } finally {
    setIsLoading(false);
  }
};
```

**What it does:**
- ✅ Uploads pitch deck to storage
- ✅ Saves document record
- ✅ **Skips AI analysis**
- ✅ Goes directly to company form
- ✅ Form pre-filled with registration data only

#### 2. Updated Upload Step UI - Two Buttons

**Before (Single Button):**
```

```

  <div className="mt-6 text-center space-y-3">
    {/* AI Button */}
    <button

      disabled={isAnalyzing || isLoading}
      className="bg-blue-600 text-white px-8 py-3 rounded-lg..."
    >
      <BarChart3 className="w-5 h-5 mr-2" />
      {isAnalyzing ? 'Analyzing with AI...' : 'Update with AI'}
    </button>
    
    {/* Or divider */}

    >
      <FileText className="w-5 h-5 mr-2" />
      {isLoading ? 'Uploading...' : 'Manually Update Company'}
    </button>

- ✅ Your deck contains company info
- ✅ You want to save time (AI fills most fields)
- ✅ You don't mind waiting 30-60 seconds
- ✅ **Recommended for most founders**

### Use "Manually Update Company" When:
- ✅ You prefer to fill in data yourself
- ✅ Your pitch deck might not have extractable text
- ✅ You want immediate access to the form
- ✅ You're more comfortable entering data manually
- ✅ Your deck is image-based or non-standard format
