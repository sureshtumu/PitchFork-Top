# ✅ Screening Function Fixed - DEPLOYED!

## Problem Fixed

The screening function was using **outdated pitch deck data** instead of **founder-corrected company information**.

### Before (❌ Wrong):
```
Pitch deck says: Revenue $800K
Founder corrects to: Revenue $1.2M
Screening uses: $800K from pitch deck ❌
Result: Incorrect rejection
```

### After (✅ Correct):
```
Pitch deck says: Revenue $800K  
Founder corrects to: Revenue $1.2M
Screening uses: $1.2M from founder ✅
Result: Accurate screening based on current data
```

## What Changed

Updated the screening prompt to **explicitly prioritize** the companies table data (founder corrections) over pitch deck content.

### New Instructions to AI:

```
OFFICIAL COMPANY INFORMATION (Verified and Corrected by Founder):
[Data from companies table]

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- The "Official Company Information" has been VERIFIED AND CORRECTED by the founder
- This information is MORE ACCURATE than what may be in the pitch deck
- USE the official company information as your PRIMARY SOURCE for screening
- The pitch deck is SUPPLEMENTARY - use it for additional context only
- If there are ANY DISCREPANCIES, ALWAYS use the official information
```

## Data Priority Hierarchy

### 1st Priority: Companies Table ✅
- Company name, industry, description
- Revenue, valuation, funding stage
- Location, website, contact info
- **Source:** Founder-verified and corrected
- **Use:** Primary screening criteria

### 2nd Priority: Pitch Deck (Supplementary)
- Team backgrounds
- Product details
- Vision and mission
- Market analysis
- **Source:** Original document
- **Use:** Additional context only

## Benefits

✅ **Accurate Screening** - Uses current, verified data  
✅ **Founder Control** - Corrections immediately affect screening  
✅ **Better Matches** - Investors see truly qualified companies  
✅ **Fewer Errors** - No more rejections due to outdated pitch deck data  

## Example Impact

### Scenario: Revenue Growth

| Data Source | Revenue | Screening Result |
|-------------|---------|------------------|
| **Pitch Deck** (old) | $800K ARR | ❌ Rejected (below $1M threshold) |
| **Companies Table** (current) | $1.5M ARR | ✅ Accepted (meets criteria) |

**OLD:** Used $800K → Rejected  
**NEW:** Uses $1.5M → Accepted ✅

### Scenario: Industry Clarity

| Data Source | Industry | Match? |
|-------------|----------|--------|
| **Pitch Deck** (vague) | "Healthcare Technology" | ❌ Unclear |
| **Companies Table** (specific) | "AI-powered Healthcare Analytics" | ✅ Clear match |

**OLD:** Unclear match → Maybe rejected  
**NEW:** Clear AI + Healthcare match → Accepted ✅

## How It Works Now

### The Screening Flow:

```
1. Founder uploads pitch deck
   ↓
2. AI extracts initial data
   ↓
3. Founder reviews and corrects:
   - ✓ Revenue: $800K → $1.2M
   - ✓ Valuation: $36M → $50M  
   - ✓ Industry: Healthcare → AI Healthcare
   ↓
4. Founder submits for screening
   ↓
5. Screening function:
   - Fetches companies table (corrected data) ← PRIMARY
   - Fetches pitch deck (original) ← SUPPLEMENTARY
   ↓
6. AI evaluates using:
   - Revenue: $1.2M (from companies table) ✅
   - Valuation: $50M (from companies table) ✅
   - Industry: AI Healthcare (from companies table) ✅
   - Team/Vision: From pitch deck (context) ✅
   ↓
7. Accurate screening decision! 🎯
```

## Testing

### Test the Fix:

1. Upload a pitch deck
2. Correct company information (revenue, valuation, etc.)
3. Submit for investor screening
4. Verify screening uses your corrections

### SQL to Check:

```sql
-- View screening results
SELECT 
  c.name,
  c.revenue as corrected_revenue,
  a.recommendation,
  a.recommendation_reason
FROM companies c
JOIN analysis a ON a.company_id = c.id
WHERE c.id = 'your-company-id'
ORDER BY a.created_at DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

## Deployment

✅ **Function:** screen-investor-match  
✅ **Status:** Deployed and live  
✅ **Effect:** Immediate - next screening uses corrected data  

## What Founders Should Know

### Your Corrections Matter! 

When you update company information:
- ✅ Revenue → Used in screening
- ✅ Valuation → Used in screening
- ✅ Industry → Used in screening
- ✅ Description → Used in screening
- ✅ All fields → Immediately active

### The pitch deck is now:
- 📚 **Supplementary context** (team, vision, product details)
- Not the primary source for screening criteria
- Used for qualitative assessment, not quantitative matching
