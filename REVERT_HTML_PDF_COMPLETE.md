Removed HTML formatting instructions from all four analysis configurations:
- `Team-Analysis`

- `Financial-Analysis`

**Before**: "...Format your response as clean HTML with inline CSS..."
**After**: "...Provide detailed, actionable insights based on the documents provided."

### 3. ✅ **Replaced PDF Generation Code**

- **Result**: All four analysis buttons will use simple PDF generation

### 5. ✅ **Cleaned Up Files**
Deleted HTML-related files:
- `UPDATE_PROMPTS_FOR_HTML_OUTPUT.sql` - SQL script for HTML prompts
- `HTML_PDF_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md` - Implementation documentation

**Kept** (for reference):
- `CHARACTER_SPACING_FIX_COMPLETE.md` - Character spacing improvements

### **Limitations**
⚠️ Basic text formatting only

## Why Was This Reverted?

You requested to undo the HTML+CSS+Playwright changes. The system has been restored to the simpler jsPDF approach that was working before.

## Testing

The reverted system is now live. When you click any analysis button:
- Analyze-Team
- Analyze-Product
- Analyze-Market
- Analyze-Financials

You'll get PDFs generated with the simple jsPDF method, just like before the HTML changes.

## If You Want HTML Back

If you want to re-implement the HTML+CSS+Playwright approach later, you would need to:

1. Change import to Playwright
2. Add HTML instructions to assistant configurations
3. Replace PDF generation code with Playwright rendering
4. Update database prompts with HTML formatting instructions
5. Redeploy the function

## Summary

✅ All Playwright changes have been reverted
✅ jsPDF-based PDF generation is restored
✅ Function is deployed and live
✅ HTML documentation files cleaned up
✅ System is back to its previous state

The analyze-company function now uses the same simple jsPDF approach as analyze-team, providing basic but functional PDF reports.
