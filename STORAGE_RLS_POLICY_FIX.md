# Storage Bucket RLS Policy Issue & Fix

## Problem Discovered

The file **exists** in Supabase storage (visible in dashboard), but the `.list()` API call returns an empty array when called from the application:

```javascript
const { data: fileList } = await supabase.storage
  .from('analysis-output-docs')
  .list(folderPath, { search: report.file_name });

// Returns: fileList = [] (empty array)
// Even though file exists at: 08d8f876-00e2-4366-ae34-48ffd9edabf8/neuralert_team-analysis_2025-10-11T14-56-23.pdf
```

## Root Cause: Row Level Security (RLS) Policies

The `analysis-output-docs` storage bucket has **restrictive RLS policies** that:
- ‚úÖ Allow authenticated users to **create signed URLs** (which works)
- ‚ùå Don't allow authenticated users to **list files** in the bucket

This is actually a **common security pattern** - you want users to access specific files they know about, but not browse/list all files in the bucket.

## The Fix: Skip Verification, Proceed with Download

### What Changed

**Before:**
```typescript
// Check if file exists
if (!fileList || fileList.length === 0) {
  setMessageStatus({ type: 'error', text: 'File not found' });
  return; // ‚ùå Stop here - never try to download
}

// Create signed URL
const { data } = await supabase.storage
  .from('analysis-output-docs')
  .createSignedUrl(report.file_path, 60);
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Check if file exists (best effort)
if (!fileList || fileList.length === 0) {
  console.warn('File not found via list (might be RLS restriction)');
  console.log('Will attempt direct download anyway...');
  // ‚úÖ Continue anyway - don't stop
}

// Create signed URL (will work even if list didn't)
const { data } = await supabase.storage
  .from('analysis-output-docs')
  .createSignedUrl(report.file_path, 60);
```

### Why This Works

Different storage operations require different permissions:

| Operation | Permission Needed | Works for Users? |
|-----------|------------------|------------------|
| `.list()` | `SELECT` on bucket | ‚ùå No (blocked by RLS) |
| `.createSignedUrl()` | `SELECT` on specific file | ‚úÖ Yes |
| `.download()` | `SELECT` on specific file | ‚úÖ Yes |

So even though `.list()` fails, `.createSignedUrl()` succeeds because it operates on a **specific file path** rather than listing the bucket.

## How to Test the Fix

### 1. Refresh Your Browser
Hard refresh to get the new code:
- **Windows:** `Ctrl + Shift + R`
- **Mac:** `Cmd + Shift + R`

### 2. Try Downloading
1. Go to the company detail page
2. Click the download button on a team analysis report
3. **Check the console logs:**

You should see:
```
Downloading report: 08d8f876-00e2-4366-ae34-48ffd9edabf8/neuralert_team-analysis_2025-10-11T14-56-23.pdf
Checking if file exists in folder: 08d8f876-00e2-4366-ae34-48ffd9edabf8
File not found via list operation (might be RLS restriction)
Will attempt direct download anyway...
Creating signed URL for download...
Signed URL created successfully
Download successful, file size: 123456
```

### 3. Verify Download
The file should download to your downloads folder automatically!

## Optional: Configure Storage Bucket Policies

If you want to **enable file listing** for authenticated users (so the verification works), you can add RLS policies to the storage bucket.

### Option A: Allow List for Authenticated Users (Recommended)

**In Supabase Dashboard:**
1. Go to **Storage** ‚Üí **Policies** ‚Üí `analysis-output-docs`
2. Click **New Policy** ‚Üí **For SELECT operations**
3. Add this policy:

```sql
-- Policy Name: Allow authenticated users to list their analysis reports
-- Operation: SELECT
-- Check Expression:
(bucket_id = 'analysis-output-docs'::text) 
AND 
(auth.role() = 'authenticated'::text)
```

This allows authenticated users to list files but still keeps the bucket private.

### Option B: Restrict List to Specific Users

If you want more granular control:

```sql
-- Policy Name: Allow investors to list reports for their analyzed companies
-- Operation: SELECT
-- Check Expression:
(bucket_id = 'analysis-output-docs'::text) 
AND 
EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 
  FROM analysis 
  WHERE analysis.investor_user_id = auth.uid()
  AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = analysis.company_id::text
)
```

This allows investors to only list reports for companies they've analyzed.

### Option C: Keep It Restricted (Current Setup)

**Do nothing** - the current fix allows downloads to work without listing permissions. This is actually the **most secure approach** because:
- ‚úÖ Users can only access files they have the exact path to
- ‚úÖ Users cannot browse/discover other files in the bucket
- ‚úÖ Downloads still work via signed URLs

## Why the Verification Was Added (Context)

The file existence check was originally added to:
1. Detect "orphaned records" (database records pointing to non-existent files)
2. Show helpful error messages before attempting download
3. List available files for debugging

However, with proper upload verification in the `analyze-team` function (which we also added), orphaned records should no longer be created, making the verification less critical.

## Current State: Best of Both Worlds

‚úÖ **Files are generated reliably** - Upload verification prevents orphaned records  
‚úÖ **Downloads work** - Even when list operations are restricted  
‚úÖ **Security is maintained** - Users can't browse the bucket  
‚úÖ **Good UX** - Clear error messages if signed URL creation fails  
‚úÖ **Debugging info** - Detailed console logs for troubleshooting  

## Summary

**Problem:** `.list()` returns empty due to RLS policies, blocking downloads  
**Solution:** Proceed with signed URL creation even when `.list()` fails  
**Result:** Downloads work! File verification is now "best effort" rather than required  
**Security:** Maintained - users still can't browse the bucket  
**Optional:** Add RLS policy to enable listing if desired  

## Test It Now!

1. Hard refresh your browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Try downloading a report
3. It should work! üéâ

If it still doesn't work, share the console logs and we'll debug further.
