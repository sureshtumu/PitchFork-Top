## 📊 Database Schema Changes

### Analysis Table - NEW Fields

```sql
ALTER TABLE analysis
  ADD COLUMN recommendation_reason text,
  ADD COLUMN history text DEFAULT '';
```

**New Schema:**
```sql
analysis table:
  id                      uuid PRIMARY KEY
  company_id              uuid REFERENCES companies(id)
  investor_user_id        uuid REFERENCES auth.users(id)
  status                  text ('submitted', 'in_progress', 'completed', 'rejected')
  overall_score           numeric (0-10)
  recommendation          text
  comments                text
  recommendation_reason   text          ← NEW!
  history                 text          ← NEW!
  analyzed_at             timestamptz
  created_at              timestamptz
  updated_at              timestamptz
```

### Companies Table - REMOVED Field

```sql
ALTER TABLE companies
  DROP COLUMN key_team_members;
```

**Field Removed:**
- ❌ `key_team_members` (text) - No longer needed in companies table

---

## 🎯 Rationale

### Why Add to Analysis Table?

**1. recommendation_reason (text)**
- Tracks WHY a specific recommendation was made
- Helps investors document their decision logic
- Useful for team discussions and reviews
- Audit trail for investment decisions

**2. history (text)**
- Audit trail of changes to the analysis
- Track status changes and updates
- Record when analysis was modified
- Useful for compliance and reviews

### Why Remove from Companies Table?

**key_team_members**
- Better suited for dedicated team analysis reports
- Team info captured in team analysis PDF reports
- Reduces redundancy
- Cleaner company data model
- Team details are analysis-specific, not general company info

---

## 📝 UI Changes Summary

### Forms No Longer Show:
```
Key Team Members
[John Doe (CEO), Jane Smith (CTO)]
```

### Removed From:
- Founder submission form
- Company edit form
- Submit files form
- Test files extracted data display

### Why Removed from UI?
- Team information now captured in Team Analysis reports
- Dedicated team analysis with AI generates comprehensive team info
- No need for simple text field when we have AI-powered team analysis
- Cleaner, more focused company information forms

---

## 🔄 Impact on Workflows

### Founder Submission Workflow
**Before:**
```
Upload → AI Analysis → Company Details (including team) → Select Investors → Dashboard
```

**After:**
```
Upload → AI Analysis → Company Details (no team field) → Select Investors → Dashboard
```

### Investor Analysis Workflow
**Before:**
```
View company → See basic team info (text field) → Analyze
```

**After:**
```
View company → Run Team Analysis (AI) → Get comprehensive team report
```

**Better because:**
- AI extracts detailed team information
- Professional PDF report generated
- More comprehensive than a text field
- Scored analysis with recommendations

---

## 📊 Migration Details

### To Deploy:
```bash
npx supabase db push
```

### What Happens:
1. ✅ Adds `recommendation_reason` column to `analysis` table
2. ✅ Adds `history` column to `analysis` table (default empty string)
3. ✅ Removes `key_team_members` column from `companies` table

### Data Impact:
- **analysis table**: All existing rows get empty `recommendation_reason` and `history`
- **companies table**: `key_team_members` data will be LOST (archived in backups)

⚠️ **Note:** If you want to preserve existing `key_team_members` data, export it before running migration.

## 🎨 New Analysis Table Usage

### How recommendation_reason Will Be Used:

```typescript
// When investor makes a recommendation
await supabase.from('analysis').update({
  recommendation: 'Invest',
  recommendation_reason: 'Strong technical team with proven track record in AI/ML. Market opportunity is significant ($10B TAM). Product has clear competitive advantages. Revenue growth of 25% MoM indicates strong PMF.',
  overall_score: 8.5,
  status: 'completed'
});
```

### How history Will Be Used:

```typescript
// Track changes to analysis
const currentHistory = analysis.history || '';
const newEntry = `[${new Date().toISOString()}] Status changed from 'in_progress' to 'completed' by ${investor.name}\n`;

await supabase.from('analysis').update({
  history: currentHistory + newEntry,
  status: 'completed'
});
```

**Example history field:**
```
[2025-10-09T12:00:00Z] Analysis started by David Kim
[2025-10-09T12:45:00Z] Status changed from 'submitted' to 'in_progress' by David Kim
[2025-10-09T13:30:00Z] Team analysis completed - Score: 8/10
[2025-10-09T14:15:00Z] Status changed from 'in_progress' to 'completed' by David Kim
[2025-10-09T14:15:00Z] Recommendation: Invest - Strong team and market opportunity
```
